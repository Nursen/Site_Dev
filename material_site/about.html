                                Hi, I'm Nursen! This is my corner of the internet where I store my thoughts on things I like. Here you'll find my reccommendations for books and cooking blogs along with anecdotes from my life living in various cultures and cool tidbits I learn about biology and algorithms. Think of this as a space to explore my mind. If you see something interesting, feel free to go off on a tangent, that's kind of what I do best. Enjoy!
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                1992 - 1995 Born two days after Christmas in Alabama, but lived in Ankara, Turkey for most of my early life. (My dad used to be in the military in Turkey, which is why we lived there. Turkish was my first language, and I still speak it fluently, though my vocabulary is much larger in English.)
                                1996 - 2004 Lived in a few different places in southern Alabama (I went to 5 different schools in these years!), visited Istanbul, Turkey every few summers, sometimes for a few months at a time. (I took my first solo plane trip when I was about 10 years old and got stuck in New York! Luckily my Aunt Cynthia lives on Long Island and was able to get me. I highly reccommended sending young children on plane rides by themselves. It instills independence, responsibility, confidence and a sense of adventure!)
                                2005 - 2006: Spent a couple of summers taking college courses in Long Island before high school. Hey, Stonybrook! (My professors called me Dougie Houser, but I was too young to get the reference. I also highly reccomend sending young teens to community college... Psychology 101 made high school a lot less confusing!)
                                2007 - 2011: Went to high school at the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham, AL. I was in the Math and Science Department. I boarded at school during the week and loved making friends from different countries like me. (Going to an arts school seems to have left a lasting impression on me, since I somehow always have a way of finding creative people for friends!)
                                2011 - 2015: I went to college at MIT in Boston, MA. I studied Molecular Biology and Computer Science and did research at the MIT Lab for Gynepathology research. (It was my childhood dream to be an OB/GYN, so I was a pre-med in college, and I've taken the MCAT twice, landing in the 96th percentile both times, but I never went through with applying to Medical School!)
                                2015 - 2018: I lived in Seattle, WA for 3 years while I worked as a Software Engineer for Microsoft. I met my sweetheart here and got into west coast swing dancing, rock climbing, hiking, biking, camping, and playing with electronics. I also started learning to play the ukelele! 
                                2018 - 2019: I moved back to Boston, MA where I'm currently trying to make a career for myself in computational biology. My sweetheart also changed jobs and now lives in New Haven, CT so we go back and forth a lot, and we both have family in Long Island, so we visit once a month! (Even though I'm in Boston now, 90% of everything I own is still in Seattle in storage units. I'm looking forward to a trip back to load it up and make my move final!)
                                Other tidbits:
                                I'm the youngest of 4, and there's a 10 year gap between me and my closest sibling. So I've been an aunt since I was 5, and I have 3 nieces and 4 nephews who I love dearly (and all except my baby niece are closer to me in age than my oldest sibling!)
                                My Meyers-Briggs is ENFP, and I'm a Type 2 Enneagram with Type 3c curls. 
                                I love cooking food for my friends, but they have a hard time getting me to make the same recipe twice!
                                I LOVE Harry Potter and as a kid I wrote hundreds of pages of fan fiction.
                                I enjoy wearing all sorts of hats. In college, one of organic chemisty professors called me "unicorn" because of the unicorn hat I wore to class so often. The nickname stuck and my friends often give me unicorn-themed gifts, which I love! 
                                I have 5 races, but I identify as bi-ethnic, because I was raised with two cultures.
